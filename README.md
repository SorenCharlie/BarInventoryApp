## Description

Description
The Bar Inventory App is a web application designed to help bar owners and staff manage their drink inventory. It allows users to:

- Add, view, update, and delete drinks.
- Track ingredients used in each drink.
- Manage and view inventory levels.
- The app uses Node.js with Express for the server-side logic, PostgreSQL with Sequelize for the database, and Handlebars.js for the UI.
